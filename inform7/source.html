You have just flown into Los Angeles to investigate a supposed drug deal that resulted in an explosion, twenty seven dead bodies, and a lone survivor--a cripple with the name of Roger 'Verbal' Kint. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You are in the lobby of the LAPD. The places reeks of tabacco. You have Verbal's files in your hands.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">A door leads North to the office of Sergeant Rabin, the officer on this case, where Verbal is being held.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Verbal's files is here. Verbal's files is scenery. The description of Verbal's files is &quot;<span class="quote">Roger 'Verbal' Kint, 33 years old. Last police record was in Los Angeles County jail, reason is fraud. Sentence ninety days, suspended.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The bulletin board has a number called the state. The state is 0.</p><p class="indent0">The paperwork has a number called the state. The state is 0.</p><p class="indent0">The wanted posters has a number called the state. The state is 0.</p><p class="indent0">The rap sheets has a number called the state. The state is 0.</p><p class="indent0">The coffee mug has a number called the state. The state is 0.</p><p class="indent0">Sergeant Rabin's Office is north of LAPD Lobby. &quot;<span class="quote">Sergeant Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. The desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking catastrophe of wanted posters and rap sheets. This is in the neighborhood of decades. Rabin is a man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Verbal is a man in Sergeant Rabin's Office.</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">Verbal is sitting in the middle of the room. He has a deeply lined face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a slight but not debilitating palsy. He fidgets and nervously sips his cup of coffee out of a porcelain mug.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Your training tells you to ask Verbal about the drug deal.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The bulletin board is here. The paperwork is here. The wanted posters is here. The coffee mug is here. The rap sheets is here.</p><p class="indent0">The bulletin board is scenery. The description of the bulletin board is &quot;<span class="quote">One might note it's sturdy construction and it's convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten and disregarded notes and facts. One might want such a bulletin board for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a bulletin board. A metal plate on its aluminum frame bears the name of the manufacturer: Quartet - Skokie, Illinois.</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0">After examining the bulletin board:</p><p class="indent1">now the state is 1;</p><p class="indent1">rule succeeds.</p><p class="indent0">The paperwork is scenery. The description of the paperwork is &quot;<span class="quote">It contains mostly tax information from the IRS. The police have to pay taxes too. You think about the amount you paid last year and sigh.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After examining the paperwork:</p><p class="indent1">now the state is 1;</p><p class="indent1">rule succeeds.</p><p class="indent0">The wanted posters is scenery. The description of the wanted posters is &quot;<span class="quote">The most dangerous criminal in Guatemala: Horst Walther Overdick, alias 'El Tigre.' He is the biggest drug trafficker and was reported captured in April 2012 only to be found missing in his cell two years later.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After examining the wanted posters:</p><p class="indent1">now the state is 1;</p><p class="indent1">rule succeeds.</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">The rap sheets is scenery. The description of the rap sheets is &quot;<span class="quote">It is an eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a three hundred pound man. His aliases stand out.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Slavin, Bricks, Shank, Redfoot, Thee, Rooster...</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After examining the rap sheets:</p><p class="indent1">now the state is 1;</p><p class="indent1">rule succeeds.</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">The coffee mug is scenery. The description of the coffee mug is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a mass manufactured coffee mug from Kobayashi porcelain. Since the LAPD slashed their budgets last year you're pretty sure it's under $5.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After examining the coffee mug:</p><p class="indent1">now the state is 1;</p><p class="indent1">rule succeeds.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of telling someone about something, try asking the noun about it.
